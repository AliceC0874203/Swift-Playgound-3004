let blackHeart = "\u{2665}"      // ♥,  Unicode scalar U+2665
let sparklingHeart = "\u{1F496}" // 💖, Unicode scalar U+1F496

//: ## Initializing an Empty String
var emptyString = ""               // empty string literal
var anotherEmptyString = String()  // initializer syntax
// these two strings are both empty, and are equivalent to each other
//: ### isEmpty property
if emptyString.isEmpty {

//: ## String Mutability
var variableString = "Horse"
variableString += " and carriage"
// variableString is now "Horse and carriage"

let constantString = "Highlander"
//constantString += " and another Highlander"
// this reports a compile-time error - a constant string cannot be modified
//: ## Working with Characters
//: ### Iterating over the string with a for-in loop:
for character in "Dog!🐶" {
    print(character)
}
// D
// o
// g
// !
// 🐶
//: ### Character type annotation:
let exclamationMark: Character = "!"
//: ### passing an array of Character values as an argument to its initializer:
let catCharacters: [Character] = ["C", "a", "t", "!", "🐱"]
let catString = String(catCharacters)
print(catString)
// Prints "Cat!🐱"
//: ## Concatenating Strings and Characters
//: * addition operator (+)
let string1 = "hello"
let string2 = " there"
var welcome = string1 + string2
// welcome now equals "hello there"
//: * addition assignment operator (+=):
var instruction = "look over"
instruction += string2
// instruction now equals "look over there"
//: * append a Character or String value to a String variable
welcome.append(exclamationMark)
// welcome now equals "hello there!"
//: ## String Interpolation
//: * Each item is wrapped in a pair of parentheses, prefixed by a backslash (\):
let multiplier = 3
let message = "\(multiplier) times 2.5 is \(Double(multiplier) * 2.5)"
// message is "3 times 2.5 is 7.5"
//: ## Unicode
//: ### Unicode is an international standard for encoding, representing, and processing text in different writing systems.
let chick = "\u{1F425}"
//: ### Extended Grapheme Clusters
//: * An extended grapheme cluster is a sequence of one or more Unicode scalars that (when combined) produce a single human-readable character.
let eAcute: Character = "\u{E9}"                         // é
let combinedEAcute: Character = "\u{65}\u{301}"          // e followed by
// eAcute is é, combinedEAcute is é

let enclosedEAcute: Character = "\u{E9}\u{20DD}"
// enclosedEAcute is é⃝

let regionalIndicatorForUS: Character = "\u{1F1FA}\u{1F1F8}"
// regionalIndicatorForUS is 🇺🇸

//: ## Counting Characters
let unusualMenagerie = "Koala 🐨, Snail 🐌, Penguin 🐧, Dromedary 🐪"
print("unusualMenagerie has \(unusualMenagerie.count) characters")
// Prints "unusualMenagerie has 40 characters"
//: ### Note!!!

/*:
 ### String Indices
 * **startIndex** property -> access the position of the first Character of a String
 * **endIndex** property -> the position after the last character in a String
    * If a String is empty, startIndex and endIndex are equal

//: * substrings aren’t suitable for long-term storage
