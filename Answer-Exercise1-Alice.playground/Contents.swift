 Constants and Variables

 Exercise 1.3
 Declare an integer variable with an explicit type annotation and then one without.

 Exercise 1.4
 Declare a constant integer value that represents the number of wheels of a car. Don't assign it a value on the same line.
 On the next line, assign a value to the constant. Why does this work?

 Exercise 1.13 EXTRA CREDIT
 The following code will print true, which means that valueA and valueB are equal. Why are they equal? (The << is the bitshift left operator.)

 Hereâ€™s how bit shifting looks in Swift code:

 let shiftBits: UInt8 = 4   // 00000100 in binary
 shiftBits << 1             // 00001000
 shiftBits << 2             // 00010000
